This repository contains the content for a beginner's tutorial on python coding.
The tutorial includes a basic demonstration of:
- Installing an instance of python directly onto a USB flash drive
- Using the built-in IDE
- "Hello world"
- Basic algebra
- Variable usage
- Package installation (e.g. numpy) using the command line
- Array operations with numpy
- Plotting using matplotlib.pyplot
- Grabbing code from GitHub
- Demonstration of GUI and random-walk animation
- Consulting LLMs for help with basic coding

The tutorial is not meant to be exhaustive in any sense, but rather is designed to 
help a user see the initial potential of the language. Further, the user should see
that now widely-accessible LLMs such as ChatGPT can act as instructors for basic coding
principles, especially when the desired outcome is clearly defined.
